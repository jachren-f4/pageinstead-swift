## How ASINs Were Found

For your reference, here's how to extract ASINs from Amazon URLs:

### Method 1: Look for `/dp/`
```
https://www.amazon.com/.../dp/B0F2M5DNBW?...
                          ^^^^^^^^^^
                          This is the ASIN!
```

### Method 2: In URL parameters
```
?pd_rd_i=B0F2M5DNBW
         ^^^^^^^^^^
         Also appears here
```

**ASIN Format:**
- Always 10 characters
- Kindle books usually start with "B"
- Physical books are often all numbers (ISBN-10)

## Testing Your Affiliate Links

To test the generated links:

1. **Build and install app to device**
2. **Block an app** in PageInstead
3. **Try opening blocked app** ‚Üí Shield with quote appears
4. **In future History view:** Tap "Buy on Amazon" button
5. **Link will be:**
   ```
   https://amazon.com/dp/B00IWUKUVE?tag=elitegamede06-20
   ```

### What Users in Other Countries See

Since you only have US affiliate account:
- **US users:** See `amazon.com` with your tag
- **UK users:** See `amazon.com` with your tag (fallback)
- **Germany users:** See `amazon.com` with your tag (fallback)
- **All regions:** Use your US affiliate tag

This is correct! They'll be redirected to their local Amazon if they have an account there, and you'll still get credit.

## Future Enhancements

### When You Add More Regions

If you later join Amazon Associates in other countries:

1. Edit `affiliate-config.json`:
```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "redirectBaseUrl": null,
  "affiliateTags": {
    "US": "elitegamede06-20",
    "UK": "yournewtag-21",      ‚Üê Add here
    "DE": "yournewtag-22"        ‚Üê And here
  }
}
```

2. AffiliateService will automatically:
   - Detect user's region
   - Use correct tag

No code changes needed!
