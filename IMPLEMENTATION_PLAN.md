## Overview
This plan implements Opus's Liquid Glass design system across all 4 core screens of PageInstead, skipping the Dashboard view. Implementation order prioritizes reusable components first, then screen-by-screen updates.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation & Reusable Components (2-3 hours)

### 1.1 Codebase Audit
**Goal:** Understand current structure and dependencies

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Review existing `LiquidGlassStyles.swift` - what modifiers exist?
- [ ] Review existing `Colors.swift` - what colors are defined?
- [ ] Check `QuoteScheduler.swift` - does it track quote view counts?
- [ ] Check if app usage stats are tracked anywhere
- [ ] List all files that import/use current design system

**Output:** Document of current state + files to modify

---

### 1.2 Core Component: CircularProgressRing
**File:** `PageInstead/Core/DesignSystem/Components/CircularProgressRing.swift` (new)

**Reference:** `opus-mockups/README.md` lines 313-342

**Component API:**
```swift
CircularProgressRing(
    progress: Double,           // 0.0 to 1.0
    gradient: LinearGradient,   // Custom gradient colors
    lineWidth: CGFloat = 8,
    showPercentage: Bool = true
)
```

**Features:**
- Gradient stroke using `AngularGradient` or `LinearGradient`
- Animated progress changes with spring animation
- Background circle at 0.1 opacity
- Center percentage text (optional)
- Rotation offset (-90°) to start at top

**Used in:**
- Current Quote View (2 rings: Focus Time, Quotes Seen)
- History View (stats cards)

---

### 1.3 Core Component: ActivityBarChart
**File:** `PageInstead/Core/DesignSystem/Components/ActivityBarChart.swift` (new)

**Reference:** `opus-mockups/opus-current-quote.html` lines 170-185

**Component API:**
```swift
ActivityBarChart(
    data: [Double],           // Array of values 0-1
    highlightIndex: Int? = nil,
    barSpacing: CGFloat = 4,
    cornerRadius: CGFloat = 2
)
```

**Features:**
- Mini bar chart (7 bars typically)
- Last/highlighted bar uses gradient fill
- Other bars use white 0.15 opacity
- Responsive height based on value
- Used below cards to show activity pattern

**Used in:**
- Current Quote View (below progress rings)
- App Blocking View (below app cards)
- History View (activity overview)

---

### 1.4 Core Component: FloatingOrb
**File:** `PageInstead/Core/DesignSystem/Components/FloatingOrb.swift` (new)

**Reference:** `opus-mockups/README.md` lines 95-123

**Component API:**
```swift
FloatingOrb(
    colors: [Color],
    size: CGFloat = 300,
    blurRadius: CGFloat = 80,
    animationDuration: Double = 20
)
```

**Features:**
- Circular gradient with heavy blur
- Infinite floating animation (ease in/out)
- Random offset and scale animation
- Low opacity (0.3-0.5)

**Used in:**
- Shield Screen (2-3 orbs)
- Potentially as subtle background on other screens

---

### 1.5 Core Modifier: ShimmerEffect
**File:** `PageInstead/Core/DesignSystem/LiquidGlassStyles.swift` (update)

**Reference:** `opus-mockups/README.md` lines 53-70

**Modifier:**
```swift
extension View {
    func shimmerEffect() -> some View
}
```

**Features:**
- Horizontal gradient sweep (clear → white 0.05 → clear)
- 3 second linear animation, repeats forever
- Overlay on interactive cards
- Should be maskable to card shape

**Used in:**
- Current Quote View (quote card)
- Interactive cards throughout app

---

### 1.6 Update: Enhanced Glass Card Styles
**File:** `PageInstead/Core/DesignSystem/LiquidGlassStyles.swift` (update)

**Reference:** `opus-mockups/README.md` lines 264-285

**Updates to existing `.liquidGlassCard()`:**
- Change background to `Color.white.opacity(0.05)` + `.ultraThinMaterial`
- Increase corner radius to 24px (from current value)
- Update border to `Color.white.opacity(0.1)`
- Add shadow: `.shadow(color: .black.opacity(0.3), radius: 20, y: 10)`
- Increase backdrop blur to 60px if possible

**New modifiers to add:**
- `.liquidGlassHeroCard()` - Larger padding, radius 32px
- `.liquidGlassStatCard()` - Smaller variant for metrics
- `.gradientBorder(colors: [Color])` - For shield screen quote card

---

### 1.7 Update: Color Palette
**File:** `PageInstead/Core/DesignSystem/Colors.swift` (update)

**Reference:** `opus-mockups/README.md` lines 344-367

**Add new colors:**
```swift
// Background gradients (Opus uses darker purples)
static let backgroundDarkPurple = Color(hex: "1a0033")
static let backgroundMidPurple = Color(hex: "330066")
static let backgroundBrightPurple = Color(hex: "4d0073")

// Progress ring gradients
static let progressGradientStart = Color(hex: "667eea")
static let progressGradientEnd = Color(hex: "764ba2")

// Accent gradients for different metrics
static let focusGradient = LinearGradient(...)
static let quotesGradient = LinearGradient(...)
static let activityGradient = LinearGradient(...)

// Glass tints
static let glassWhite = Color.white.opacity(0.05)
static let glassBorder = Color.white.opacity(0.1)
```

---

### 1.8 Core Component: AnimatedGradientBackground
**File:** `PageInstead/Core/DesignSystem/Components/AnimatedGradientBackground.swift` (new)

**Reference:** `opus-mockups/opus-dashboard.html` lines 26-46

**Component:**
```swift
struct AnimatedGradientBackground: View
```

**Features:**
- Base gradient: dark purple → mid purple → bright purple
- Overlay radial gradients (3 circles) with slow animation
- 20 second ease in/out cycle
- Scale + rotation animation
- Fixed position behind all content

**Used in:**
- All 4 main screens as background replacement

---

## Phase 2: Screen Implementation (4-6 hours)

### 2.1 Current Quote View Redesign
**File:** `PageInstead/Features/CurrentQuoteView.swift`

**Reference:** `opus-mockups/opus-current-quote.html`

**Layout Structure:**
```
AnimatedGradientBackground
└── VStack
    ├── Header ("Current Quote")
    ├── Time indicator pill (16:25 - 16:30)
    ├── Quote card (hero style, shimmer effect)
    │   ├── Large quote text
    │   └── Book info (cover, title, author)
    ├── HStack (2 stat cards)
    │   ├── CircularProgressRing (Focus Time) + ActivityBarChart
    │   └── CircularProgressRing (Quotes Seen) + ActivityBarChart
    └── "Get This Book" button (gradient)
```

**New Data Requirements:**
- Focus time today (time spent on blocked apps that were prevented)
- Quotes seen today (count)
- Hourly activity pattern (7 values for mini bars)

**Implementation Notes:**
- Keep existing `.onReceive(Timer.publish...)` for auto-refresh
- Add shimmer effect only to hero quote card
- Circular progress rings should animate on appear
- Activity bars should show last 7 windows or last 7 hours

---

### 2.2 Data Layer: Focus Time & Quote Tracking
**Files:**
- `PageInstead/Core/Services/QuoteScheduler.swift` (update)
- `PageInstead/Core/Services/FocusTimeTracker.swift` (new?)

**New tracking needed:**
1. **Quotes Seen Counter**
   - Increment when `getCurrentQuote()` returns different quote
   - Store in UserDefaults with date key
   - Reset daily at midnight

2. **Focus Time Counter**
   - This is tricky: iOS doesn't tell us when blocking happens
   - **Option A:** Estimate based on quote views (each view = ~30sec saved)
   - **Option B:** Track app foreground time as "focus time"
   - **Option C:** User self-reports (manual tracker)

3. **Hourly Activity Pattern**
   - Track which 5-minute windows had quote views
   - Group by hour for last 7 hours
   - Return array of counts for ActivityBarChart

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Add `QuoteViewTracker` singleton
- Persist data in UserDefaults or Core Data
- Expose via `@Published` properties for SwiftUI

---

### 2.3 App Blocking View Redesign
**File:** `PageInstead/Features/Blocking/AppSelectionView.swift`

**Reference:** `opus-mockups/opus-app-selection.html`

**Layout Structure:**
```
AnimatedGradientBackground
└── VStack
    ├── Header + subtitle
    ├── Status banner (green, "Blocking Active, 4 apps")
    ├── HStack (3 stat pills)
    │   ├── Blocks Today
    │   ├── Blocks This Week
    │   └── Time Saved
    ├── Section: "Blocked Apps"
    ├── App Grid (2 columns)
    │   └── App cards with shield badge
    ├── Section: "Available to Block"
    ├── App Grid (2 columns)
    │   └── App cards (tappable)
    └── "Save Changes" button (gradient)
```

**New Data Requirements:**
- Blocks today count
- Blocks this week count
- Time saved estimate
- App categories for filtering (Social, Entertainment, etc.)

**Implementation Notes:**
- Replace `FamilyActivityPicker` with custom grid (still use picker as modal)
- Show app icons using existing blocked apps set
- Add "Add More Apps" button that triggers `FamilyActivityPicker`
- Selection state management with Set<ApplicationToken>

**Challenge:** Getting app icons from `FamilyActivityPicker` selection
- Tokens are opaque, can't get app metadata directly
- May need to show generic category icons instead
- Or keep using `FamilyActivityPicker` but style it to match design

---

### 2.4 History View Redesign
**File:** `PageInstead/Features/History/QuoteHistoryView.swift`

**Reference:** `opus-mockups/opus-quote-history.html`

**Layout Structure:**
```
AnimatedGradientBackground
└── VStack
    ├── Header ("History")
    ├── Daily summary card (glass)
    │   ├── Metrics grid (3 columns)
    │   │   ├── Quotes Seen
    │   │   ├── Blocks
    │   │   └── Time Saved
    │   └── 12-column activity chart (bar graph)
    ├── Week selector (horizontal scroll)
    │   └── 7 day pills
    ├── Section: "Recent Quotes"
    └── List of quote history items
        └── Card (time badge, quote, book, emoji)
```

**New Data Requirements:**
- Daily aggregated stats
- 12-hour activity bars (blocks per 2-hour window)
- Weekly data for day selector
- Quote history with exact timestamps

**Implementation Notes:**
- Keep existing time-window based history
- Add aggregation layer for metrics
- Use Swift Charts for 12-hour activity chart?
- Or custom bar chart using Capsule shapes
- Week selector should highlight current day

**Data Source:**
- Existing quote history (already tracked?)
- Add blocking events tracking if not exists
- Store in UserDefaults or Core Data

---

### 2.5 Shield Screen Redesign
**File:** `ShieldConfiguration/ShieldConfigurationExtension.swift`

**Reference:** `opus-mockups/opus-shield-screen.html`

**Layout Structure:**
```
ZStack {
    AnimatedGradientBackground
    FloatingOrb (2-3 instances, different colors)
    VStack
        ├── Pulsing shield badge (100x100 rounded square)
        ├── App name ("Twitter is blocked")
        ├── Quote card (gradient border, hero style)
        │   ├── Opening quote mark
        │   ├── Large quote text
        │   └── Book info (mini cover, title, author)
        ├── "Get This Book" button (blue glass tint)
        ├── "Return to Home" button (secondary)
        ├── Time window indicator pill
        └── Dismiss hint text
}
```

**Implementation Notes:**
- This is the most animated screen (justified as it's a blocking moment)
- FloatingOrbs should have staggered animation delays
- Shield badge should pulse continuously (scale 1.0 → 1.05)
- Quote card gradient border using `.overlay(AngularGradient...)`
- Must work within FamilyControls ShieldConfiguration constraints
- Test that animations don't cause performance issues

**Critical:**
- Shield Extension can't access main app's UserDefaults directly
- Must use App Groups (`group.com.pageinstead`)
- QuoteScheduler must work independently in extension
- Book cover loading might be slow/fail in extension context

---

## Phase 3: Integration & Polish (2-3 hours)

### 3.1 Haptic Feedback
**Files:** Multiple view files

**Add haptics to:**
- App selection/deselection (light impact)
- Button taps (medium impact)
- Quote refresh (soft impact)
- Blocking event (heavy impact in shield)

**Implementation:**
```swift
import UIKit

UIImpactFeedbackGenerator(style: .light).impactOccurred()
```

---

### 3.2 Accessibility: Reduce Motion
**Files:** All animation components

**Add support:**
```swift
@Environment(\.accessibilityReduceMotion) var reduceMotion

// In animation code:
.animation(reduceMotion ? .none : .liquidGlassSpring, value: state)
```

**Affected components:**
- FloatingOrb (disable animation)
- ShimmerEffect (disable)
- CircularProgressRing (instant progress, no animation)
- AnimatedGradientBackground (static gradient)

---

### 3.3 Performance Testing
**Device testing required:**

1. **Battery Impact:**
   - Run app for 30 minutes
   - Monitor battery drain
   - Check if animations cause excessive drain

2. **Frame Rate:**
   - Use Xcode Instruments (Time Profiler)
   - Ensure 60fps during animations
   - Check for dropped frames on scroll

3. **Memory:**
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Check for leaks in animation loops
   - Test on iPhone with lower RAM

4. **Shield Extension:**
   - Must launch quickly (<1 second)
   - Animations should be smooth
   - Test on slow network (book covers)

---

### 3.4 Visual Polish Pass

**Final adjustments:**
- [ ] Typography: ensure SF Pro Display is used consistently
- [ ] Spacing: verify all padding matches Opus mockups
- [ ] Colors: double-check gradient hex values
- [ ] Animations: fine-tune spring dampening and duration
- [ ] Shadows: ensure shadows aren't too heavy on dark backgrounds
- [ ] Borders: verify glass borders are visible but subtle

---

## Phase 4: Testing & Iteration (2 hours)

### 4.1 Screen Time Integration Testing
**Critical tests:**
- [ ] Grant Screen Time permission flow still works
- [ ] App selection persists correctly
- [ ] Shield screen shows consistently when blocking
- [ ] Shield screen shows correct quote (time-synced)
- [ ] Multiple apps blocked at once works
- [ ] Blocking survives app restart

### 4.2 Quote System Testing
**Critical tests:**
- [ ] Quote changes every 5 minutes
- [ ] Same quote in main app and shield
- [ ] Daily variation works (different quotes same time each day)
- [ ] Auto-refresh in CurrentQuoteView works
- [ ] Book covers load correctly
- [ ] Amazon affiliate links work

### 4.3 Edge Cases
**Test scenarios:**
- [ ] First launch (no data)
- [ ] Midnight rollover (daily stats reset)
- [ ] Airplane mode (book covers fail to load)
- [ ] VoiceOver enabled (accessibility)
- [ ] iPhone SE (small screen)
- [ ] iPhone Pro Max (large screen)
- [ ] Dark mode (should already be dark)
- [ ] Light mode (if supported - may need adjustment)

---

## Dependencies & Blockers

### Technical Constraints

1. **FamilyControls API Limitations:**
   - Can't get app names/icons from ApplicationToken
   - Shield extension has limited UI customization
   - Must use App Groups for shared data

2. **iOS Version Requirements:**
   - iOS 16.0+ required (current minimum)
   - Swift Charts requires iOS 17+ (for history graph)
   - Some Material effects might need iOS 17+

3. **Data Tracking Challenges:**
   - No API to detect blocking events
   - Must estimate "focus time" and "blocks prevented"
   - Can track quote views as proxy for engagement

### Unknowns to Investigate

- [ ] Can Shield Extension animate smoothly? (performance testing needed)
- [ ] Can we show app icons in custom blocking UI? (may need to keep FamilyActivityPicker)
- [ ] Does backdrop blur work in Shield Extension? (may have restrictions)
- [ ] How to track "blocks prevented" accurately? (estimation required)
