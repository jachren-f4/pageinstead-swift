# Question for Swift Expert: DeviceActivityMonitor Event Tracking Issue

## Context from Previous Discussion

You previously helped us identify that **Shield Configuration Extensions cannot write to App Group storage** due to iOS platform restrictions. Based on your recommendation, we implemented a **DeviceActivityMonitor extension** to track when apps are blocked.

## What We've Implemented

### Architecture
```
User blocks apps
    ‚Üì
ScreenTimeService applies shields + starts DeviceActivityCenter monitoring
    ‚Üì
Shield Extension displays quote (can only read, not write)
    ‚Üì
DeviceActivityMonitor detects usage ‚Üí saves event to App Group ‚úÖ
    ‚Üì
Main app reads events and displays history
```

### DeviceActivityMonitor Setup

**In ScreenTimeService.swift:**
```swift
func startMonitoring(for selection: FamilyActivitySelection) {
    let schedule = DeviceActivitySchedule(
        intervalStart: DateComponents(hour: 0, minute: 0),
        intervalEnd: DateComponents(hour: 23, minute: 59),
        repeats: true
    )

    var events: [DeviceActivityEvent.Name: DeviceActivityEvent] = [:]

    if !selection.applicationTokens.isEmpty {
        let eventName = DeviceActivityEvent.Name("blockedAppUsage")
        let event = DeviceActivityEvent(
            applications: selection.applicationTokens,
            threshold: DateComponents(second: 1)  // Trigger after 1 second
        )
        events[eventName] = event
    }

    try activityCenter.startMonitoring(monitoringActivityName, during: schedule, events: events)
}
```

**In DeviceActivityMonitorExtension.swift:**
```swift
override func intervalDidStart(for activity: DeviceActivityName) {
    super.intervalDidStart(for: activity)
    print("üìä DeviceActivityMonitor: Interval started")

    // Save a test event to verify monitor is working
    saveBlockingEvent(eventName: "intervalStart", activityName: activity.rawValue)
}

override func eventDidReachThreshold(_ event: DeviceActivityEvent.Name, activity: DeviceActivityName) {
    super.eventDidReachThreshold(event, activity: activity)
    print("üö® DeviceActivityMonitor: Event threshold reached!")

    // Save the blocking event to App Group
    saveBlockingEvent(eventName: event.rawValue, activityName: activity.rawValue)
}

private func saveBlockingEvent(eventName: String, activityName: String) {
    let quote = // ... get quote
    let event = ShieldEvent(
        quoteId: quote.id,
        timestamp: Date().timeIntervalSince1970,
        blockedApp: "Blocked App"
    )
    ShieldDataStore.shared.saveShieldEvent(event)  // ‚úÖ This works!
}
```

## Current Behavior (Problem)

### What Works ‚úÖ
1. DeviceActivityMonitor extension builds and embeds successfully
2. Main app can write/read from App Group (verified)
3. `intervalDidStart` fires once per day and saves an event
4. Events saved from DeviceActivityMonitor appear in Quote History

### What Doesn't Work ‚ùå
1. User opens blocked app 10+ times
2. Shield displays quotes correctly each time
3. User waits 2-5 seconds after each app open
4. **Only 1-2 events appear in history** (the intervalStart event + maybe one threshold event)
5. `eventDidReachThreshold` rarely fires (maybe once per monitoring interval?)

### Observations
- The 1-second threshold event seems to track **cumulative usage time** across the entire monitoring interval (24 hours)
- Once the threshold is reached, the event doesn't fire again until the next monitoring interval
- This means we only get one event per day, not one per app open attempt

## Our Questions

### 1. Is `DeviceActivityEvent` with thresholds the wrong approach for tracking app blocks?

We want to track **every time a user tries to open a blocked app**, not cumulative usage time. It seems like `DeviceActivityEvent` thresholds are designed for parental controls (e.g., "alert when child has used TikTok for 1 hour today"), not for detecting individual blocking attempts.

**Question:** What's the correct API to detect when a shielded app is accessed/blocked?

### 2. Alternative Approaches?

Since DeviceActivityMonitor callbacks don't seem suited for tracking individual shield displays, what should we do?

**Option A: Is there a different DeviceActivityMonitor callback we should use?**
- Maybe there's a callback that fires on app launch attempts?
- Or a way to detect when shields are shown?

**Option B: Can Shield Extensions communicate with the main app?**
- Darwin Notifications?
- XPC Services?
- Any IPC mechanism that would allow Shield to notify the main app when displayed?

**Option C: Background Tasks in main app?**
- Can the main app run background tasks to check Screen Time logs?
- Is there an API to query "when was my shield last displayed"?

**Option D: Accept the limitation?**
- Maybe iOS intentionally doesn't provide APIs to track shield displays for privacy reasons?
- Should we accept that we can only track "intervals" not individual blocks?

### 3. DeviceActivityMonitor Best Practices?

**Current implementation:**
- 24-hour monitoring interval
- 1-second threshold on blocked app usage
- Save event when threshold reached

**Questions:**
- Should we use multiple shorter intervals instead of 24 hours?
- Are thresholds even applicable to shielded apps (since they're blocked immediately)?
- Is there a better way to configure DeviceActivityEvent for our use case?

### 4. What are DeviceActivityMonitor extensions actually designed for?

From Apple's documentation, it's not clear:
- Are they meant for parental control time limits?
- Can they detect individual app launches?
- Do they work with shielded apps at all?

## What We Need

We want to show users a history of quotes they've seen when trying to access blocked apps. Ideally:
- User opens blocked app ‚Üí sees quote ‚Üí event saved with that quote
- History shows: "2:30 PM - You tried to open Instagram and saw a quote from Maya Angelou"

Currently we can only save 1 event per monitoring interval, which means the history is mostly empty.

**Is there a way to achieve per-block tracking with iOS Screen Time APIs, or is this a fundamental limitation?**

## Previous Expert Guidance That Worked

Your previous advice to use file-based storage in DeviceActivityMonitor was correct! The monitor CAN write to App Group successfully. The issue is just getting it to fire frequently enough.

## Summary

**Working:** DeviceActivityMonitor can save events to App Group ‚úÖ
**Not Working:** Events only fire 1-2 times per day, not per app block ‚ùå
**Question:** What's the correct way to track individual shield displays with iOS APIs?

Thank you for your expertise! üôè
