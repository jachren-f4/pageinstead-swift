## ‚úèÔ∏è Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Open the File
```bash
open QUOTES_TO_CURATE.txt
```

### 2. For Each Book, Do This:

**Read all 6 quotes** (sorted shortest ‚Üí longest)

**Example:**
```
BOOK: Build: An Unorthodox Guide to Making Things Worth Making

ASIN: B08BKSJX1M

QUOTE 4:

**Pick your 2 favorites**
- Usually the **2 shortest** are best for shield UI
- But choose based on what resonates with you
- Consider: Which would YOU want to see when distracted?

**Edit the tags**
- My suggestions are there, but feel free to change
- Format: `TAGS: business, leadership, wisdom`
- Max 3 tags, comma-separated

**DELETE the 4 unwanted quotes**
- Select from `QUOTE X:` to the blank line after tags
- Delete the entire block
- Leave only 2 quotes per book

### 3. Save the File
Just save it with your edits (keep the same filename)

### 4. Convert to JSON
```bash
python3 finalize_quotes.py QUOTES_TO_CURATE.txt

## ‚ùì Questions?

**"Can I keep 3 quotes per book instead of 2?"**
Yes! Just leave 3 quotes in the file. The script will take whatever you leave.

**"What if I want different books?"**
Re-run with `--min-highlights` parameter to change which books are included.

**"Can I add quotes manually?"**
Yes! Just follow the format in the TXT file and the converter will pick them up.

**"Do I have to edit all 148 books?"**
Yes, to get 296 final quotes. But you can do it in batches - edit 50 books, convert, test, then do more.

Happy curating! üìö‚ú®
